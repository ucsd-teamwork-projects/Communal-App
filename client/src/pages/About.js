                    <p>We're glad you asked.</p>
                    <p>Communal is a social app designed to bring people together through exploring their cities.</p>
                    <p>Imagine swiping through a dating app without the empty feeling inside.</p>
                    <p>Communal brings people together through what we call Socials, basically events you join or create. Through Socials, you get to explore your city and hopefully make some new friends along the way!</p>
                    <p>You can discover hobbies, clubs, speakeasys and more!</p>
                    <p>Much like bees, people need community and we hope to facilitate those gatherings with Communal.</p>
